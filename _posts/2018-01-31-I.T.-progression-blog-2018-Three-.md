I.T. progression blog 2018 Three 

What went well: Today me and my partner will worked really well together to make the Barcelona football badge and we succeeded in creating six of the nine squares needed to complete it. Plus we saved it onto a USB drive and so we can access our work again another time.

What didn't go so well: We ran out of time and we didn’t complete our design, also one of the calculations that I did was faulty so when we submitted it it didn’t look right however we fixed it in time. 

What I am going to do next time: Next time I am going to involve Bowas more in the work as he didn't really join in because he didn’t want to but he is in our group. I’m also going to double check my calculations so we can make the proper image.
