My Identity blog

I think That I put in a good amount of work and I'm happy with the sore I received, (75/100). I felt that most of the comments that were written on my sheet were fair and either complementary or constructive. From the feedback Iâ€™ve learned that I need to: use capital letters, add colour and make my writing more legible, maybe by using lines. Aspects that people did like about my map were: the design/layout and the detailed descriptions that I gave about my life now, my future aspirations and how I do/will use media.
