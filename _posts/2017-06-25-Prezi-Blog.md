Prezi Blog

 My homework assignment was to play around with a program called Prezi that helps you to create an insightful and clever presentation. First I chose a background format for me to expand upon. Being a comic book fan I was roughly basing my tester presentation on Why batman is so brilliant. I found it really easy to add images and adding text was simple too.

 The way that the different sections of the Prezi can be zoomed in on from another part of the presentation I found easy to insert and breath-taking to watch. The only problem that I had was when trying to add a video: at first I tried to copy and paste the link that the video gave in the description but it didn't like it, then i write clicked on the link and chose, "download link file as" and it still didn’t like it so I did what it told me to and copied the link in the URL bar, so when that didn’t work I couldn’t think of what else to try. However overall it was easy to use and really good if you’re making a presentation for anything.
