I.T. progression blog 2018 One

What went well: Me Will and Boaz managed to put together the Fuze box very quickly. Because of this we were able to get on with lots of work including writing hello world and making the shape of a space invader. I also helped a lot of my peers to set up and code on their Fuze's.

What didn't go so well: one person took charge and had the longest amount of time to code what they wanted to code. Because of this not everyone got to do what they wanted on the Fuze box.

What i am giong to do next time: Next time I am going to focus more on my work so that I can get as much work done as possible. I am also going to take charge a bit more.
