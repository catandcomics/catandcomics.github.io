I.T. progression blog 2018 Two

What went well: During this week's lesson Bowas Will and I all managed to draw, calculate and input the code to make a man bounce a ball.  

What didn't go so well: No-one in the class could figure out how to save their work on the USB sticks so no-one was able to save their work and see what they did.

What i am giong to do next time: Next time I am going to focus more on my own group because one I missed half of the lesson due to counciling and two I started to help Ravi which took up lots of time.
