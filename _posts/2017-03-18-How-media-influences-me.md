How media influences me

  Media is everywhere and it influences pretty much every body's lives. Sometimes without us even realising. Here are a few examples that have and still do influence me: Instagram, Snapchat, The news, TV, the radio and even video games. I use Instagram all the time and that is a type of media called social media. It tells me about everything my friends are doing and what they like, and because of Donald Trump’s coverage, a lot of memes that make fun of him are floating around. But it’s strange to think that a mildly funny image and a few letters can completely warp some-one’s view and maybe their whole train of thought.

  Another example of this is the news. The news and newspapers all have different political views meaning that depending on which party you support their will be a news channel that you will agree with. For example news stations such as Channel 4 news have a more left wing outlook and the daily express have a quite right wing point of view.   . My biggest influence are definitely my parents because like them I am against BREXIT, I disagree with Donald Trump's views on immigration and I prefer the views of Labour . But this I think is changing dramatically because most of our information comes from the internet and so this may consume our lives.
