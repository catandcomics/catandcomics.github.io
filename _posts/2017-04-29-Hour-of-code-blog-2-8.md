  <tr>
    <td>I followed the instructions on the game. Some of them were quite straight-forward because we had used scratch before. But I learned about a nice feature where you can repeat and then put in the amount of times you want it to repeat and I hadn't seen that before today. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>On the first game I tried I didnâ€™t quite understand it so I gave up and moved to the next one.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will have another go at whatever I find hard instead of giving up.</td>
